Who: `Full-stack internship`
When: `January 06, 2020`
For: `Polygon`

## Welcome to the matrix

Join Polygon's core team on our mission to use technology to provide clarity for people with learning differences like dyslexia, ADHD, and autism. We are a young and well-funded startup based in the sunny Los Angeles. We are deeply mission-driven, entrepreneurial, and value open communication to drive toward the best answer.

One in five people has a learning difference, but many go undiagnosed due to high costs and long wait times. We believe that, if properly identified and harnessed, a learning difference can be a remarkable strength. Our vision is to give every person with a learning difference the full range of tools they need to thrive, from diagnosis to support.

## The coding exercice

For this full-stack position, I'll ask you to build a simple but complete system. It will be composed of **3 containers**, all wrapped into the same **Docker compose**. (1) A Vue.js application relying on the material design library Vuetify to build the graphical interface. (2) A FastAPI python backend on the server-side. (3) A MySQL instance to store the data in the single table Trackings. The goal is to simply intercept and monitor all requests made to the backend, store their signature and have a specific route processing the data, as wireframed.

## What I care about

There are a few elements that do have a big importance to me:

* A properly documented chain of thoughts.
* A proper usage of hierarchy in a Vue.js project.
* Good UI taste.
* A proper documentation of FastAPI methods, would it be to feed a Redoc or Swagger instance.
* Good code practices, would it be simple PEP8 or any linter/prettifier you deem worthy of existence.
* A great project structure, pushed to Github, and rightly associated to a nice _README.md_.
